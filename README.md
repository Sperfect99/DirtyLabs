# DirtyLabs
A personal collection of Python-based tools for learning ethical hacking and penetration testing.

# 🧪 DirtyLabs — My Personal Pentesting Playground

**DirtyLabs** is my personal space for publishing small tools and experiments in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and offensive security.

This repo begins with my very first project: **DirtyRAT** — a basic educational Remote Access Tool written in Python.  
More tools, experiments, and scripts will be added as I continue to learn and grow in this field.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I created this repository to:

- Learn how offensive security tools work internally
- Practice Python scripting in a practical way
- Experiment with real-world penetration testing concepts
- Build my portfolio as a beginner in the ethical hacking world

## 🐀 Project 1 — DirtyRAT

My first custom RAT client/server built with Python sockets.  
Supports screenshots, keystroke logging, process listing, shell commands, and system info reporting.

📁 See [`DirtyRAT/`](./DirtyRAT) folder for code and instructions.

## 🛠️ What's Next?

More scripts and tools are on the way:

- Key injectors  
- File transfer clients  
- Process hiders  
- Encrypted shells  
- Wi-Fi scanners  
- ...and more

Stay tuned 👀

## 🧠 Final Note

This repo marks my very first step into the world of scripting and pentesting.  
I’m still learning — and every line of code here is part of that process.  
Improvements are welcome!
